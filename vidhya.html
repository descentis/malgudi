                                    <h5>About Me</h5>
                                    I am a research scholar @ Malgudi Labs under Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar, department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Ropar.
                                    I finished my BTech. (2013-2017 batch) in Computer Science and Engineering from SRM University, Chennai.
                                    After my BTech., I joined PhD in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Ropar, in August 2017.<br/><br/>
                                    I hail from a place called Chidambaram in Cuddalore District, TamilNadu, India. Being the only daughter, I always got great love and support from my family.
                                    My lovely family comprises of my father who is an Associate Professor in Chemical Engineering and my mother who is currently a home-maker. Before marriage she worked as a teacher. Coming from such a family of academicians motivated me to pursue my career towards research and academia. The thing that I like the most about this profession is that it helps you stay connected to your concepts as you are continuosly brushing them up. Also I find that academicians feel young as they constantly move with youngsters. In addition to staying connected with scratch concepts it is also essential to keep oneself updated. This is possible through research. Hence I opted Ph.D which according to me is a journey of making oneself ready into the enthralling world of teaching and research.

                                   <br/><br/>


                                    <h5>Hobbies:</h5>
                                    My hobbies include listening to music, reading books, watching movies, etc.To know more about me just be with me for sometime. You would find a simple, fun loving, positive person around you.<br/><br/>

                                  
                                    <h5>Experience @ Malgudi Labs : </h5>
                                    I met <a href='http://sudarshaniyengar.com' target="blank">Dr. sudarshan Iyengar</a> first time during the PhD interview. I was amazed by his great knowledge, experience, simplicity and down to earth nature. After that we had some conversations and he always motivated me towards research. He is such a caring and trustworthy person that my parents have agreed to leave their only daughter at a place 2500km away without a second thought.
                                    I love being with positive and motivating people around. I'm fortunate to be a part of Malgudi family which consists of such people who are highly affectionate, close knit and caring. I see Malgudi labs as a team of young researchers, where whole lot of discussions take place and we grow helping each other in a symbiotic manner. <br/><br/>
