                                <h5>About Me</h5>
                                Hi people!! :) I am a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, India. I am a person who enjoys working in team and is a part of wonderful team, Malgudi. I believe that working together brings the best out of you. I love thoughtful discussions and doing Yoga.<br/><br/>
                                <b>How i reached here?</b><br/><br/>
                                I was born in a small district of Haryana, named as Rohtak. The first school that I have attended is Shri Baba MastNath Public School Rohtak , where I developed the perfectionist attitude. There was so much competition in studies at my school that some people,  including me, used to  work even in the lunch breaks. Then in 9th grade I shifted to Model School Rohtak, one of the prestigious school in Rohtak. I have passed my 10th from there, scoring 10 point cgpa. After that I have joined Bharat Mata Saraswati Bal Mandir School Narela in delhi,  as a non attending student because I no longer felt the need for schooling in 11th and 12th. Also, another reason was that, I want to focus on my IIT JEE preparation and needed a lot of time for that. So then, finally, in 2013 I completed my 12th from there scoring 88.6% marks. I know it's low but my main aim was to get into IIT and I achieved that. I scored 192 marks with a rank of 2368, and got into IIT Ropar. A whole new experience was waiting for me here.<br/><br/>

                                At IIT Ropar, I got to meet lot of people from all over India with different backgrounds, all with exceptional talents. I learnt a lot (currently learning too) from each and every person at IIT Ropar. Here only I met <a href='http://sudarshaniyengar.com' target="blank">Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar</a> who changed my perspective about research all together and help me to reach where I am now. <br/><br/>
                                Initially, when I joined IIT Ropar I too, as most of the people in my branch, used to think that I will aim for highly paid jobs in multinational companies. But later I saw the enjoyment and thrill that the logical thinking and discussions have. Only later I realise the pleasure it gives you, when you get in depth of topics and find new things that no one has seen.<br/><br/>
                                Now my main aim is to become a good researcher and share its joy with others. <br/><br/>
                                <b>What I like?</b><br/><br/>
                                I am always ready to be part of any thoughtful discussion. Other than that I enjoy hiking, cycling, Table Tennis, and most of all Yoga.I just love doing yoga.I want to start my own yoga classes once I achieve sufficient capital for it. (By capital I donâ€™t mean just money but good amount of skills). <br/><br/>

                                <h5>Experience</h5>
                                I joined Malgudi after my second year. Since then Malgudi is an integral part of my life. Malgudi is my home away from home.
                                Malgudi gave me a lot of memories whether it is wonderful lectures given by <a href='http://sudarshaniyengar.com' target="blank">Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar</a> who explains things so well and in a very intuitive way that no one can forget that, or be it the reading club activities or wonderful debates and discussions or morning pranayama sessions and so many other things. Malgudi gave me the experience of how efficient it is to work in a collaborative environment which I truly appreciate now. Working in group brings the best out of you.<br/><br/>

                                Everyone here helps each other and pushes each other to give their best. It is because of Malgudi group and <a href='http://sudarshaniyengar.com' target="blank">Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar</a> only that I am able to appreciate the importance of research and am able to find the joy out of it. Malgudi provided me the collaborative research environment that is very hard to find anywhere in the world.<br/><br/>
                                I have learnt so much from Malgudi. Only because of Sudarshan sir, I get to start doing Yoga and I truly enjoys the high and joy that one gets out of it. I am really thankful to him for teaching me yoga. I have learnt from everyone in Malgudi. Be it Varsha, from whom I learnt to always stay positive, or be it Yayati, whom exceptional creativity pushes you be more creative too, or be it Anamika whom great writing skills encourages you to write better, or be it Akriti whom speed in thinking and management qualities make you feel to adopt them as well, or be it my room mate Jaspal, from whom you can learn to be very critical in everything, or be it Amanjot from whom you can learn to keep pushing forward and last but not the least our professor who is all rounder and have so many qualities that I can not list them here.<br/><br/>

                                So in short, I can say Malgudi is like crash course for me to learn a lot of things and become a better person. <br/><br/>
