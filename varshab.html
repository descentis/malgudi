                                    <h5>About me</h5>
                                    I was born in the “Garden City of India”, officially known as Bengaluru. My journey in academics began in St. Paul’s English School, where I completed my primary and secondary schooling. Motivated by the wonderful teachers who were responsible for fostering curiosity and inquisitiveness towards science, I decided to pursue higher secondary education at  Sri Kumaran Children’s Home Composite Junior College (2007-2008). I took up physics, chemistry, mathematics as my major subjects, while a flare for programming lead me to take up computer science as an elective. I believe I was gifted to have teachers like Mrs. Preethika and Mrs. Smitha, who not only showed us the fun aspects of programing, but gave us the much needed exposure to the algorithmic perspective to computer science. This inspired me to take up Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Computer Science, which I completed from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering (batch of 2009). It was during my college days when I met <a href='http://sudarshaniyengar.com' target="blank">Professor. Sudarshan Iyengar</a>, who came to our institute as a guest faculty and taught us Discrete Mathematics. The opportunity of an internship at the Indian Statistical Institute Chennai, with <a href='http://sudarshaniyengar.com' target="blank">Professor Sudarshan Iyengar</a>, was the first time I was exposed to the idea of research in computer science. This was when I decided that I would not put an end to this journey of learning and continue by pursuing a PhD in Computer science :) This marked the beginning of a new journey - <b>Doctor of Philosophy</b> at Malgudi labs :D<br/><br/>
                                    <h5>Experience @ Malgudi Labs</h5>
                                    Travelling a distance of 2421 km from Bangalore to Rupnagar, has indeed been a fruitful experience. When I learnt the fact that I was selected for the PhD programme at IIT Ropar, I was excited and at the same time felt sad that I would be going away from home. Today, however, I have no doubts in saying that Malgudi Labs is nothing less than a home to all of its members. <br/><br/>
                                    I am a 3rd year graduate student, in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering , IIT Ropar. I am a part of Team Malgudi, which consists of all the research scholars and undergraduate students working under the supervision of <a href='http://sudarshaniyengar.com' target="blank">Professor Sudarshan Iyengar</a>.  The team consists of students with diverse personality, working on an equally diverse set of questions: from cryptography, knowledge building to social network analysis: each one has a story to tell. We have scholars who have had many years of teaching experience, scholars who previously worked in the industry, fresh undergraduate students as well as quite a handful of students who are currently pursuing their BTech at IIT Ropar. Although there are people belonging to such a variety of age groups, the most important characteristic that knits us all together is our perpetual <b>“curiosity for the sciences”</b>.  We are not just restricted to our projects, but participate in the discussion of the other scholars in the team and brainstorm collectively. I’d like to add, before anyone who is reading concludes that we just too geeky, that apart from churning knowledge together, we also actively get together for reading club, outings to celebrate happy occasions, hiking along the beautiful canal of Ropar, cycling, and many more.<br/><br/>

                                    As and always, I have been this curious kid who wants to try out everything. I have been a philatelist, numismatist, a Bharatanatyam dancer, a blue belt qualified Karate kid, participated at school drama, represented my school for inter-school swimming competitions, and currently I am a senior exam qualified player of an instrument known as the Veena. I love listening to music of all genre as well as love taking part in physical activities such as trekking, hiking, cycling and of course swimming :)
