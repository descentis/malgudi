                                    <h5>The Current Me</h5>

                                    Hi! I am Yayati Gupta. My job is research and my aim is to be a better human being every single day. Before telling you about  my past, I would like to brief you about the current me. Currently, I am researching the field of Social Networks Analysis and Complex Networks (which is one of the most interesting applications of Graph Theory). I do my research at Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, an autonomous public institute, ranked 9 in National Institutional Ranking Framework. I am soon going to finish my PhD and grab a doctorate degree, highest degree awarded in academia. I plan to become a professor in a renowned institution and help the students like the ”past me”. I enjoy teaching and giving presentations. One of the biggest aims of my life is to give a presentation at the TED’s main stage. The biggest source of my energy are my parents and my supervisor.<br/><br/>


                                    <h5>THE PAST ME</h5>
                                    I was born in Faridabad, the largest city and the major industrial hub of Haryana. My mumma and  papa shifted to this place from a village even before I was born, keeping in mind a better education for their kids. I was fond of reading books and writing from my childhood itself. What my mom and dad recalls today is an year old me who used to get up at 2 AM in the night and sang poems present in my elder brother’s books. I grew up studying in the nearby schools. I did my schooling from Vidya Niketan School, Faridabad, finishing my 12th in 2008. I have done my Bachelor of Technology degree from Lingayas Institute of Management, Faridabad, which is one of the premier engineering institutes in Haryana. In the first year itself, I had made up my mind to go for higher education. Passed out of the undergrad school in 2012, I secured 99.3 percentile in GATE examination, and after a written test and interview made it up to IIT Ropar. 
                                    & THAT’S WHEN MY LIFE JUST STARTED.<br/><br/>

                                    <h5>ME AND MY RESEARCH</h5>
                                    “Remember those chilled winter mornings in childhood solving maths questions with a cup of hot milk in your hand, that’s a glimpse of what research is for me”<br/><br/>
                                    I study “MEMES”, yes memes. Do you want to know how does these internet memes become viral? How Justin Beiber became a star, what is the history of this double rainbow man, why the video “Friday” got so many hits despite being hated by most of the public? Why some songs become super hits, some die, why some movies hit the box-office others could not, why Facebook is a hit but Google+ is still struggling. I am scientifically curious to answer all these appealing questions. Facebook may seem a waste of time to our parents, but for me, it is my life, in other words, a source of my income. See, in how many interesting ways do people communicate with each other. What a celebrity says sometime overshadows the common sense of common people. How often does it happen? If we could understand this secret recipe of a viral meme, we can make our seemingly mundane videos go viral too. A particular fashion in which each and every internet meme makes its way through the network seems to me the answer to this question, but this hole needs to be dig deeper ;)<br/><br/> 
                                    <h5>MY FAVOURITE PASS-TIMES</h5>
                                    Wanna have a war? bring your swords, horses, elephants and army, YES- I MEANT CHESS. This was one of the major ways in which I spent my time from childhood. I am interested in arts too, though I am not very good at it, but I occasionally split those colours on beautiful papers, grab some garbage and  transforms it into some beautiful useful material (Art Attack do you know, yes ! sound Kiddish- so am I). I love making greeting cards for my very close people. If you ever got a card from me, know that you are one of the most most most most special people in my life. And then Yes, my super-unachievable aim, which has no limits, I want to be a better human being day by day. Optimisation is not possible, but at least I want to approximate it. I read all possible good habits present on this giant web of today and fit in as many of them as possible in my daily life. We know there is no end to learning.<br/><br/>

                                    <h5>MY STARS</h5>
                                    You know them already, but i can’t resist writing a separate section for them. They are who made me what am I, who am I. I am not just me. I am THEY+me. My papa, who never differentiated a girl from a boy, for whom, I am the topmost priority of his life. Who lives for me, I must say. Then my mummy, who along with being a doctor and what I feel is the busiest lady I  have ever seen, manages all the household chores. They never wanted me to be a doctor looking at the business of my mom’s life :p. Then a teacher Ashish Singh Sisodia, who believed in me and instilled in me the confidence that I can make it up to IIT. I can never forget, the day I made it up here, and called him, before me saying anything, his words were- “Chal, Jaldi Se Khuskhabri Suna”, means “Come on! Tell me the good news quickly”. It feels they had more confidence in me than me even. Then at the last and perhaps the most important, my supervisor- <a href='http://sudarshaniyengar.com' target="blank">Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar</a>. He keeps us like a family. We work with him, play with him, listen his scoldings, sometimes are annoyed with him. I can keep writing on and on. What makes me laugh is thinking of a scenario where a scholar is afraid and runs away from her PhD again and again, and he holding her back saying that- I know , you can do it. Do it for me :D.<br/><br/>
                                    I request somebody to please change this well known quote of academia- “When you start hating your supervisor, then you are about to get your degree”. If this quote is true, I am scared my degree is in danger :)<br/><br/>

                                    <h5>Experience</h5>
                                    I have been the part of the Malgudi Labs from the second year of my PhD, when we were only four in number and have seen it extending up to 25 members during summers. Trust and unity are the two biggest factors which lay the foundation of our lab. Third factor is the Professor who wipes out all the misunderstanding and negativity out of the team. Everybody discusses their research ideas with everyone  else without fearing a  bit. Paper writing is also a very fun experience here. We have an internal paper review system. It is like your paper is reviewed by 1- people of your own domain before being submitted to a conference. We celebrate the success of others and help each other completely during the time of crisis (it can be a personal crisis as well). I have gone through a long struggling time during my PhD, but only with the support of my professor and team(no doubt my parents also), I have been able to keep it up. No one is allowed to feel lonely and isolated here. The people in the lab carry their own unique powers, which makes the team do well in all the dimensions. A lot of learning happens here.<br/><br/>
