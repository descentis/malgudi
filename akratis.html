                                    <h5>About Me</h5>
                                    I am a research scholar @ Malgudi Labs under Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar, department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Ropar.<br/><br/>
                                    I finished my BTech. (2007-2011 batch) in Computer Science and Engineering from Institute of Engineering and Technology Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.<br/><br/>
                                    After my BTech., I joined Newgen Software Technologies Ltd. Delhi in July 2011 as a Software Engineer, and worked there for two years. After that I joined State Bank Group as an IT Officer (Assistant Manager). I worked in State Bank of Patiala Head Office for one year. And after that The True Journey Of My Dreams started.<br/><br/>


                                    <h5>Childhood:</h5>
                                    I was born in district Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, India. I spent my childhood in a typical Indian joint family. Being the first-born of the family, I always got extra attention. It was a great blessing to spend my childhood days in such an environment. All family members used to spend a more time with me which helped me learn a lot. From childhood itself I started learning things quickly, so to no one’s surprise I started my schooling directly from Upper KinderGarten. <br/><br/>
                                    Since my childhood, I like mathematics the most. My mom used to teach me new techniques to solve problems. I also used to like writing so much, that I many times copied complete books. I did my primary schooling from MBVM (Mahavir Bal Vidhya Mandir) Bijnor and then joined GGIC (Govt. Girls Inter College Bijnor) from 6th standard. I always secured first position in my school. In secondary and higher secondary, I secured first place among all girls in the district.<br/><br/> 

                                    <h5>Why Computer Science?</h5>
                                    Coming from a humble background, throughout my life I have seen, technological advances make a real difference in our day to day life in every intended manner. Right from my early days when I was technically challenged, I pursued to be technically equipped at theoretical level to understand these day-to-day miracles. To gain in depth knowledge I had left a stable Banking job and decided to be research scholar instead. I simply want to put my acquired and innate cognitive abilities in the area of computer science to the best of their potential in the direction to further the advancements in this field and translate these practically to help society in an effective manner.<br/><br/>


                                    <h5>Hobbies:</h5>
                                    In free time, I like reading books on behavioural economics, cognitive science, social psychology etc. I also have collections of some authors like, Paulo Coelho, A PJ Kalam and read that in free time. These books have inspired me so much and gradually changed my perspective towards life. Books are always my best friends, but now I realized that they are a good guide too. Except reading, I have a list of hobbies, and do all these things in spare time: I like cooking and always cook for me, I always prefer to design my cloths by myself, and topped it with the hand work. I like crafts and paintings. As music is in our veins, I learned Vocal and Tabla for four years and enjoy playing it. I always like solving puzzles and it has motivated me towards research.<br/><br/>

                                    Except all this, If you want to know more about me, then be with me for sometime. You will always find a happy, helping, rational girl on your side, who has never been defeated in her life and will never let you loose!!!<br/><br/>

                                    <h5>Experience @ Malgudi Labs : </h5>
                                    First time I was selected in IIT Ropar for PhD program in July 2013, but I could not join at that time due to some reasons and joined after one year in July 2014. But I have been a part of malgudi from that time itself. I met <a href='http://sudarshaniyengar.com' target="blank">Dr. sudarshan Iyengar</a> first time during the PhD interview. After that we had some conversations and he always motivated me towards the research. I like graph theory and algorithm so much and my choices lead me to be a Malgudian.
                                    I see Malgudi labs as an initiative by young researchers, where they brainstorm, discuss, and help each other. Where a warm discussion can lead to a hot research topic. Where a deep brainstorm will be flooded by endless waves of research ideas. <br/><br/>

                                    <h5>Research Interest:</h5>
                                    Complex Networks, Social Network Analysis, Linguistic Analysis, Machine Learning
